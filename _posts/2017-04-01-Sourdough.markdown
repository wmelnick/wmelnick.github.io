Hey, it's National Sourdough Bread Day!

For those of you who don't know, I'm a big sourdough fan.

My main pal in this world is Chaz:![Chaz]({{ site.url }}/assets/ChazAtHome.jpg)

Chaz is five years old. I first found(?) him in the wall's of my parents 1890s house in November of 2011. Since then, he has moved with me all over America (if you're empty and aching, eat some bread -- that's what I always say...)

Anyway, I just want to take today to celebrate the gift of wild yeast.


May you all achieve the rise you deserve,
Will
