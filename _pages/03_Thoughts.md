##Here are some thoughts I've had recently

###Why are companies so bad at numbering their products?

First of all: I don't care how you name your product models. Many corporations use complex model name structures that don't make much intuitive sense, which is fine:

**E.G.** Samsung names its TVs UN[size in inches]XX[series number][three-digit code signifying level of features within series]FXZA. Okay, so United States (I assume), the screen size, the "series," etc. This is logical, at least. You are looking at UN50...,but you want a TV that is 58", not 50", so you move up the the UN58 models...this isn't rocket science. It's complex, but Samsung is a *giant* corporation, and they do need a logical way to differentiate between the countless products offered.)

Some companies make far fewer products than Samsung. For instance, Tesla Motors.

Tesla started out with their *Roadster* model. This was their first model. It was a roadster. Fine. Their second model released was the *Model S*, which was a *S*edan. Okay, fine. Their third Model was the *Model X*, which is an SUV, which doesn't make any sense, but hey, what does "Corolla" mean, anyway? Here is my issue, though: their forth model. What is it called? The *Model 3*. Their forth model. Uhhg.

[Apple](apple.com) makes computers. Did you know that? Yes, you did. They also make phones, or, should I say, they also make iPhones. Let's look at their iPhone releases:

1. iPhone (realeased in 2007, this was the first generation)
2. iPhone 3G (released in 2008, this model added 3G connectivity, which makes sense)
3. iPhone 3GS (released in 2009, this was an incremental update, with the exterior of the phone unchaged.)
4. iPhone 4 (released in 2010, this was the **forth model** released)
5. iPhone 4S (released in 2011, this was the fifth model released)
6. iPhone 5 (released in 2012, the iPhone 5 was the **sixth iPhone**)

What could they have done? The fact that they named the second model after the 3G features meant that iPhone 4 couldn't take it's rightful place as iPhone 3.

**Whats the real problem here?**
The real issue is that Apple is too lazy to release a new phone every year. Or: the (now defunct) system of two year phone contracts meant that Apple *could* be lazy, and, in fact, it was in their *best interest* to be lazy, as it would keep people from feeling trapped in their contracts. But really, Apple should have just planned ahead and called the 3G the 2. Let's be real.

[Microsoft](microsoft.com) makes <strike>digital prisons</strike> software. Their [trojan horse] main software is the operating system Windows. Let's look at Windows' release history. It seems like their marketing and engeneering staff may live on different planets.

Intial versions (no distinct marketing names)
* Windows v.1.x: Windows 1.x, released 1985.
* Windows v.2.x: Windows 2.x, release in...blah blah, doesn't matter
* Windows v.3.x: Windows 3.x, etc.

Then:
* Windows v.4.00: Windows 95, released in, that's right, 1995. Also, somebody will get mad for failing to mention 4.0 also includes Windows NT
* Windows v.4.10: Windows 98, released in 1998.
* Windows v.5.0: Windows 2000, released early 2000.
* Windows v.4.9: Windows ME, released late 2000. Yes, this is true. Windows ME, though being an earlier version, was released several months after 2000)
* Windows v.5.1: Windows XP, released in 2001, less than a year after the turd that was ME (it was based on NT, and by extension Windows 2000)
* Windows v.6.0: Windows Vista, released in 2006, five years after XP. The main "Vista" was the BSOD, as I recall...
* Windows v.6.1: Windows 7

Let's take a break here to recap: The early versions were named after their software versions. Then, they were named after the year they were released. Windows ME was, as I recall, "Millenium Edition." I'll give them a pass for this. Windows XP, Vista--these names don't mean a thing. That's fine. I don't have a problem with marketing names. I have a problem with adults who can't count.

Why would they name Windows version 6.1 "Windows 7?" There is no reason for this. They could have named it something else. They probably could have named it "Windows 6.1" and gotten away with it (they can get away with anything, because everybody is chained by the you-know-what to their you-know-what, and we would have taken our 6.1. But we didn't. Get got Windows 6.1 masquarading as something it was not, Windows 7.

* Windows v.6.2: Windows 8. Okay, now this is just stupid. This isn't even close. Now, you're thinking, "Well, they dug themselves into an iPhone-sized naming hole. How ever will they fix this mess?"

The answer to that question, how can they solve this problem, this mess, has no answer, except maybe a stunt so rediculous, it would distract everybody from the versioning mess:

* Windows v.6.4: Windows 10.

"Oh, okay, here's what we do: let's skip Windows 9."
"Um, ok. So Windows 10 will be Windows version 7.0, or what?"
"Uhhh, we can't version it 7, because we used that name 6 years ago. We are sticking with 6.4."
"What will we do next, though? We can't stick to version 6 forever, can we?"
"We could always name the versions after types of cats...or cities in Washington..."
"Goodbye."
