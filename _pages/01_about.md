Hi! I am Will. I am an economist, developer, photographer, and anything else you will pay me to me.

## Other Stuff:

* [This](http://wsmelnick.com) contains a small collection of photographic work (technically **the photography of W.S. Melnick**, though you may consider them **mine**, and nobody else would ever want to take credit, to be honest). 
## Things I care about:

* [The Free Software Foundation](http://fsf.org) is an enormously important organization, fighting to defend the rights of all free software users (and all software users). If you are feeling trapped by your devices and the companies that <strike>made</strike> own them, you are not alone. [Shoot me an email if you don't want somebody else to tell you how to use your devices](mailto:will@willmelnick.net).

* [Co-op Power](http://cooppower.coop) is (in their words) "a multi-class, multi-racial movement for a sustainable and just energy future." They are a member-owned energy cooperative. They are doing a lot of great work in the Northeast United States, and I suggest you check them out (I also made their website).

* [Represent.Us](http://represent.us)  is a non-partisan non-profit organization working to pass anti-corruption legislation and reduce the rampant corruption in our current political system. In my opinion, the influence of “big money” is the single biggest inhibitor to our progress as a nation, and progress on almost every major issue (e.g. global climate change) is limited by the interests of those with the most resources, which is simply unacceptable.
